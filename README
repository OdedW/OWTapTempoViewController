Writing a music app and want to add a tap tempo feature? just drop the files in your project, create an instance of the controller and add its view to your view!
To get the current computed BPM just check the currentBpm property. Also available is the tempo marking of the current BPM and a class method to get the tempo marking for a certain BPM value. 

There are two ways to init the controller:
- With the desired frame (will create a standard UIButton)
- With the desired frame and an image for the button

The controller can ignores stray taps, responds well to quick change of pace (fourths to eights) and resets on a certain timeout.
Check out the sample metronome app for an example of usage, feel free to use the metronome and the blue button as you wish.
